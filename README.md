## QR Auth API

### Auth

A JSON String after decode:

```
{
    sid: "the session of the remote connecter",
    remote: "the remote page for auth, http://example.com, for example."
}
```

When receive this message, you should 

```
POST remote username=USERNAME&hash=HASH&sid=SESSIONID
```

Hash was generated by following code:

```
timestamp = parseInt((new Date().getTime()) / 1000 / 30)
hmac = crypto.createHmac 'sha512', key
hmac.setEncoding 'hex'
hmac.write [username, sid, timestamp].join('')
hmac.end()
hash = hmac.read()
```

Will receive:

```
success: {status: "success"}
```
```
error: {status: "error", error: "hash not match"}
```


### Add User

A JSON String after decode.

```
{
    remote: "the remote page for auth",
    username: "username",
    key: "user's private key, may be very long, in HEX"
}
```

You should save this in your database.
